# ffmpeg-automator

#¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯

this script will use ffmpeg calls and globs to identify and convert all .mkv and .avi files to .mp4. 
Post conversion will remove the original and automatically move the .mp4 to the desired directory based off the movie runtime.
It is setup default for 3000 secord or 50 minutes, to move tv and movies to different folders

Script is designed for no user interaction, add it to crontab and forget about it
